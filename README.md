# IpySci

Putting an graphical Jupyter interface to libraries like SymPy, SciPy, NumPy etc. for solving and plotting scientific/mathematical Problems.

This is meant to be a platform for scientists and mathematicians who don't want to focus on their work and not on output formats, plotting and coding quirks. It provides the basics for that task and can be easily extended for special tasks.
It is a tool for quick visualization and intuition and not for computing intensive simulations.

Features by now:

Easy Sympy Expression input

Derivatives and Integration

Matrix/Vector Algebra

Series and Limits

Sums and Products

Plotting 2D Graphs

Outputting Graphs as PNG/SVG

Outputting Equations as LaTeX



To Do:

Speed up LaTeX representation

3D/Vector plotting

More intuitive gui
